_Official C# Library to interact with the BeatSaver API_

## ðŸ’¾ Download
This package is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BeatSaverSharp/). It is built targeting .NET Standard 2.0, and should run in any supporting runtime.

Experimental DLLs are also built using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/lolPants/BeatSaverSharp/actions) for each push to this repository. **These are not guaranteed to be stable, so use them at your own risk.**  
You can find the download as an artifact on any passing builds.

## ðŸ”§ Usage
XML Documentation has been provided for this library. Most tasks will be done through the `BeatSaver` class.

```csharp
using System;
using BeatSaverSharp;

HttpOptions options = new HttpOptions()
{
    ApplicationName = "Test Client",
    Version = new Version(1, 0, 0),
};

// Use this to interact with the API
BeatSaver beatsaver = new BeatSaver(options);
```

## ðŸš€ Extensions
An extensions package is available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BeatSaverSharp.Extensions/) and in CI builds. This contains extension methods that enable the use of `IAsyncEnumerable<Beatmap>` for all methods that return a `Task<Page>`.

Since `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` is only available in .NET Standard 2.1 and .NET Core 3.x, these extensions are only available for those runtimes.
